	Package cmd implements all commands in cosutil. In this package, each
	subcommand is a single go file, and root is the cosutil command itself.

	Due to the restriction of dependency cobra, the global cosutil command
	arguments must be between the `cosutil` and the subcommand. For example,
	if you want to enable debug mode when downloading, you must use

		cosutil -d download cospath localpath

	but not

		cosutil download -d cospath localpath

	which will cause an parse error.
